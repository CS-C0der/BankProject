### About ###

A banking application written in java. The user can rename his bank, add customers and accounts as well as deposit money and display everything. 

## Tech ##

This project showcases OOP, data storage and an MVC structure. User-friendly communication and handling of errors combined with an intuitive Swing GUI provide a great user experience.  
The code uses only java without any dependencies. Therefore it performs at high speed and is easy to transfer and develop further. Clean code principles are applied in various ways.

## Documentation ##

In order to understand the code better, one way is to read through the Javadoc-Comments that are assigned to each class and method. 
Another way is to hover over the respective class/method in IDEs like IntelliJ and get in-place-explanations.
If you would like to read through the whole documentation as a bundle, you can export the Javadoc-Documentation in your IDE.

## Further development ##

In this first version, the output is given on the console of the IDE. 
A next step would be to give output on the GUI so that when deployed as a runnable, that output will be equally given independent from the environment.
